# Minishell for element
A Programm written in C simulating the origanl Bash/shell
orignally a co working project with Maran Siemons


The existence of shells is linked to the very existence of IT. At the time, all coders agreed that communicating with a computer using aligned 1/0 switches was seriously irritating. It was only logical that they came up with the idea to communicate with a computer using interactive lines of commands in a language somewhat close to english. With Minishell, you’ll be able to travel through time and come back to problems people faced when Windows didn’t exist

## How to execute the program

```
0. run ./run.sh
or
1. make
2. ./minishell
both cases
-exit ctrl d

```


## Structure of the project

```
0. libft -libary ( personal libary with self 
written functions simulating origanl c functions)

1. Lexer
2. Parser
3. executor


```

## Challenges 

```
1. Edge cases
2. structs/linked list
3. pointers adresses
4. Memory
5. Processes
    - fork processes
    - Binary tree
6.Research
```

## Optimalisation

```
1. start of the project No clue
2. Process
3. Binary tree
    - organising a complex project
    - Mapping out a architecture 
```


## Tests

```
1. Video showing examples
2. builtins
3. exit status
4. env
5. bin
```
